# ðŸš€ Quick start

Start developing

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

# ðŸ‘¶ Github Pages Deployment

## Important

- If you are going to use [gtag](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-google-gtag/) please create a .env file in the root directory.
The value is read from environment. The file content will look like: GA_TRACKING_ID=G-XYZ

- If you have pathprefix, please update your repository according to this [document](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/) . Otherwise your content will not be served correctly. If you're not sure about pathprefix, no worries just skip this warning. 

## Custom Domain

Update  CNAME file to access over a custom domain. Also see the following [document](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/) if you want assistance on linking a custom domain to github pages.

Following command builds and pushes the build to gh-pages branch. Which means you don't have to do anything more to deploy.
```shell
$Â npm run deploy
```


## Default domain (username.github.io)

If you don't want a custom domain and ok with what github is providing this the right option.
You can delete CNAME for this scenario

  ```shell
  npm run neatdeploy
  ```
